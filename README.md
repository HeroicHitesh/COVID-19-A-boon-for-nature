Air Pollution causes more than seven million deathd per year. In 2018, USA linked to nearly 10,000 additional deaths. More than 3/4 of annual greenhouse gases gets produced by transportation, 
industry, and power generation resulting in forcing the 90% of the global population to breath in unsafe air.
The novel COVID-19 virus has left the world reeling with thousands of deaths and lakhs of cases. The entire human life has come to a standstill with the majority of the countries enforcing shutdown/lockdown and travel bans.
Amidst this chaos, there is an unlikely beneficiary in the form
of mother nature. There is a drastic reduction in air pollution
